## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, you should be able to name and describe common Python data types.

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to perform the following tasks in Python:

- Write and run Python code in Jupyter notebooks.
- Assign values to variables.
- Create and manipulate integers, floats, bools, strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries.
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks to control program flow.
- Use `for` and `while` loops to control program flow.
- Use `try` and `except` statements to handle errors.
- Encapsulate blocks of code in functions.
- Develop an algorithm systematically.

## Advanced Track

If you have at least a year of programming experience, have completed all of the prework, and feel comfortable with all of the topics discussed above except perhaps "develop an algorithm systematically," then you have the option of taking the **advanced track** through this lesson. If you choose the advanced track, then you will be placed in a Zoom breakout room separate from the main session to complete the activities listed below. You will rejoin the main session for the Developing Algorithms module, which is a bit more advanced than the other modules. If you are comfortable with Python but haven't used JupyterLab, then you should move to the advanced track after the first module.

If you have a question, look it up and/or discuss it first with the other students in the breakout room. If you aren't able to resolve it, post it on the Slack discussion channel. If you have more than about two or three questions, then you should rejoin the main session, which you may do at any time.

- Complete the exercises in the lesson modules listed below, except for Developing Algorithms which you will complete with the rest of the class. Each module has a corresponding solutions notebook in `module_solutions/`. You may refer to the solution notebooks for code examples, but do not refer to the exercise solutions until after you have completed the exercise. At that point, use them to check your work.
- Use any time you have left to consult the additional resources given at the bottom of this document or some other Python learning resource.
